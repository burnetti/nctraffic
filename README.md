Traffic data from North Carolina, 2013-2019

The "Full Regression Code" document contains a copy of the Stata code used to analyze the data. Note that this file was broken into smaller pieces for upload to GitHub and should be combined into a single worksheet prior to analyzing.

The Excel document "NC Traffic Weather Data final" contains daily, county-level data for collision outcomes, weather data, and indicator variables necessary to run the Stata code.
